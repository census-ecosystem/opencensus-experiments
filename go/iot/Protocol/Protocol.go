Typical example for Registration request would be as below:
{
	"ProjectId" : "project-id"
	"View" : {
		"Name" : "my.org/views/protocol_test"
		"Description" : "View for Protocol Test"
	}
	"Aggregation" : {
		"AggregationType" : "LastValue" / "Sum" / "Count"
		"AggregationValue" : []
	}
	"Measure":{
		"Name" : "my.org/measure/Measure_Test"
		"Descrption" : "Measure Test"
		"Unit" : "1" / "By" / "ms"
		"MeasureType": "int64" / "float64"
	}
	"ReportPeriod" : 1

}

Note that the distribution is not supported yet.


Typical example for sending data request would be as below:
{
	"Measure":{
		"Name": "my.org/measure/Measure_Test"
		"MeasureType": "int64" / "float64"
		"MeasureValue": "1"
	}
}

Typical example for the response from Raspberry Pi would be as below:
{
	"Code": 200 (OK) / 404 (Fail)
	"Info": "Registration Successfully!"
}
